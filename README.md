# Shade picker

This is an experiment that I did to make it easy for dentist to pick a shade for a tooth.

## How to use:
1. Capture/Pick a photo that includes both your shade guide and the patient teeth.
2. Select shades by tapping on them or drawing a rectangle around them (RED).
3. Select teeth by tapping on them or drawing a rectangle around them (BLUE).
4. The app would automatically mark the shade that matches the patient's teeth as close as possible.
